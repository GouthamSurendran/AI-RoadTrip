## Your First Step To AI Adventures

### Task1:
    Getting familiar with Git and GitHub, be familiar with the basic git commands.
    Also maintain a git repo for all the tasks that you complete.

### Task2:
    Getting in touch with python.
    we shall start with a few pattern printing problems for now, just to get a feel for python.

    1st: For the user input n = 5 print the pattern.

    #
    ##
    ###
    ####
    #####
    
    2nd:For the user input n = 4 print the pattern.

       #
      # #
     # # #
    # # # #

   3rd: For the user input n = 4 print the pattern.

       1
      121
     12321
    1234321
  
  4th: For the user input n = 5 print the pattern.

    1 2 3 4 5 
     2 3 4 5 
      3 4 5 
       4 5 
        5 
       4 5 
      3 4 5 
     2 3 4 5 
    1 2 3 4 5 
  
  5th: For the user input n = 5 print the pattern.


    1 2 3 4 5 
    2 3 4 5 
    3 4 5 
    4 5 
    5 
    4 5 
    3 4 5 
    2 3 4 5 
    1 2 3 4 5 

The aim of this printing pattern is to get your  mindset into a logical and problem sloving mode.
